# Decay0
Our own Decay0 versions with several customizations (by Lutz Alth√ºser and Alexander Fieguth) based on
already existing releases for Fortran and C++. 

## Fortran
The Fortran version is used and tested within our DEC studies. It was updated on in 03/2018 to use
the most recent Xe124 Qbb and EK values. Decay0/GENBB Fortran program is written and maintained by Vladimir Tretyak (KINR) 
with updates by Jan Thurn (see also the `/doc` folder). Te-124 excited states of 0vKK have been added by C. Wittweg.

## CXX
This is a C++ clone of the Fortran code which was also updated by us to include Xe124 but was never 
used for any study. So be careful and check everything twice!
